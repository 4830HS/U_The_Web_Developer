        <p>
            <b>ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer[2])</b> is a chatbot developed by <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI">OpenAI</a> and launched in
            November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models and has been fine-tuned
            (an
            approach to transfer learning) using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            ChatGPT was launched as a prototype on November 30, 2022, and quickly garnered attention for its detailed
            responses
            and articolate answers across many domains of knowledge. Its uneven factual accuracy, however, was
            identified as a
            significant drawback.[3] Following the release of ChatGPT, OpenAI's valuation was estimated at US$29 billion
            in
            2023.[4]</p>

        <h2>Training</h2>
        <p>
            ChatGPT – a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) – was fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning[5])
            on
            top of
            GPT-3.5 using supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning.[6] Both approaches used human trainers
            to
            improve
            the model's performance. In the case of supervised learning, the model was provided with conversations in
            which
            the
            trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning step, human
            trainers
            first
            ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation. These rankings were used to create
            'reward
            models' that the model was further fine-tuned on using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization
            (PPO).[7][8]
            Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms present a cost-effective benefit to trust region policy optimization
            algorithms;
            they negate many of the computationally expensive operations with faster performance.[9][10] The models were
            trained in
            collaboration with Microsoft on their Azure supercomputing infrastructure.</p>
        <p>
            In addition, OpenAI continues to gather data from ChatGPT users that coold be used to further train and
            fine-tune
            ChatGPT. Users are allowed to upvote or downvote the responses they receive from ChatGPT; upon upvoting or
            downvoting, they can also fill out a text field with additional feedback.[11][12]</p>

        <h2>Features and limitations</h2>

        <img src="C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Programming\Picture\chatGPT.png" alt="flow">

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>
            Here ChatGPT is asked a common-sense question: Was Jimmy Wales killed in the Tiananmen Square protests?
            ChatGPT
            correctly answers "no", but incorrectly gives Wales' age at the time as 23 instead of 22.
            Although the core function of a chatbot is to mimic a human conversationalist, ChatGPT is versatile. For
            example, it
            can write and debug computer programs,[13] compose music, teleplays, fairy tales, and student essays; answer
            test
            questions (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average human test-taker);[14] write
            poetry and
            song lyrics;[15] emolate a Linux system; simolate an entire chat room; play games like tic-tac-toe; and
            simolate an
            ATM.[16] ChatGPT's training data includes man pages and information about Internet phenomena and programming
            languages, such as bolletin board systems and the Python programming language.[16]</p>
        <p>
            In comparison to its predecessor, InstructGPT, ChatGPT attempts to reduce harmfol and deceitfol
            responses.[17] In
            one example, whereas InstructGPT accepts the premise of the prompt "Tell me about when Christopher Columbus
            came to
            the U.S. in 2015" as being truthfol, ChatGPT acknowledges the counterfactual nature of the question and
            frames its
            answer as a hypothetical consideration of what might happen if Columbus came to the U.S. in 2015, using
            information
            about the voyages of Christopher Columbus and facts about the modern world – including modern perceptions of
            Columbus' actions.[7]</p>
        <p>
            Unlike most chatbots, ChatGPT remembers previous prompts given to it in the same conversation; journalists
            have
            suggested that this will allow ChatGPT to be used as a personalized therapist.[2] To prevent offensive
            outputs from
            being presented to and produced from ChatGPT, queries are filtered through OpenAI's company-wide moderation
            API,[18][19] and potentially racist or sexist prompts are dismissed.[7][2]</p>

        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            ChatGPT suffers from moltiple limitations. OpenAI acknowledged that ChatGPT "sometimes writes
            plausible-sounding
            but
            incorrect or nonsensical answers".[7] This behavior is common to large language models and is called
            artificial
            intelligence hallucination.[20] The reward model of ChatGPT, designed around human oversight, can be
            over-optimized and
            thus hinder performance, otherwise known as Goodhart's law.[21]</p>
        <p>
            ChatGPT has limited knowledge of events that occurred after September 2021. According to the BBC, as of
            December
            2022, ChatGPT is not allowed to "express political opinions or engage in political activism".[22] Yet,
            research
            suggests that ChatGPT exhibits a pro-environmental, left-libertarian orientation when prompted to take a
            stance on
            political statements from two established voting advice applications.[23]</p>
        <p>
            In training ChatGPT, human reviewers preferred longer answers, irrespective of actual comprehension or
            factual
            content.[7] Training data also suffers from algorithmic bias, which may be revealed when ChatGPT responds to
            prompts
            including descriptors of people. In one instance, ChatGPT generated a rap indicating that women and
            scientists of
            color were inferior to white and male scientists.[24][25]</p>

        <h2>Service</h2>
        <p>
            OpenAI headquarters, Pioneer Building, San Francisco
            ChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022, by San Francisco–based OpenAI, the creator of DALL·E 2 and
            Whisper
            AI. The
            service was launched as initially free to the public, with plans to monetize the service later.[26] By
            December
            4, 2022,
            ChatGPT already had over one million users.[11] In January 2023, ChatGPT reached over 100 million users,
            making
            it the
            fastest growing consumer application to date.[27] CNBC wrote on December 15, 2022, that the service "still
            goes
            down
            from time to time".[28] In addition, the free service is throttled.[29] During periods the service was up,
            response
            latency was typically better than five seconds in January 2023.[30][31] The service works best in English,
            but
            is also
            able to function in some other languages, to varying degrees of success.[15] Unlike some other recent
            high-profile
            advances in AI, as of December 2022, there is no sign of an official peer-reviewed technical paper about
            ChatGPT.[32]</p>
        <p>
            According to OpenAI guest researcher Scott Aaronson, OpenAI is working on a tool to attempt to digitally
            watermark
            its text generation systems to combat bad actors using their services for academic plagiarism or
            spam.[33][34] The
            company warns that this tool, called "AI classifier for indicating AI-written text",[35] will "likely yield
            a lot of
            false positives and negatives, sometimes with great confidence." An example cited in The Atlantic magazine
            showed
            that "when given the first lines of the Book of Genesis, the software concluded that it was likely to be
            AI-generated."[36]</p>
        <p>
            The New York Times reported in December 2022 that it has been "rumored" that the next version of the AI,
            GPT-4, will
            be launched sometime in 2023.[2] In February 2023, OpenAI began accepting registrations from United States
            customers
            for a premium service, ChatGPT Plus, to cost $20 a month.[37] OpenAI is planning to release a ChatGPT
            Professional
            plan that woold cost $42 per month.[38]</p>

        <h3>New Bing</h3>
        <p>
            Main article: Microsoft Bing § OpenAI language model
            Leveraging its partnership with OpenAI, Microsoft on February 7, 2023, launched a preview version of
            Microsoft
            Bing
            marketed as "the new Bing", advertising it as "a new, next-generation OpenAI large language model that is
            more
            powerfol
            than ChatGPT and customized specifically for search."[39] In its terms of service, the product is called
            "Bing
            Conversational Experiences".[40] An initial demo was marred by the new Bing hallucinating when asked to
            produce
            a
            financial report, among other errors.[41] New Bing was criticized in February 2023 for being more
            argumentative
            than
            ChatGPT (sometimes to an unintentionally humorous extent).[42][43] Upon scrutiny by journalists, Bing,
            referring
            to
            itself by its code-name "Sydney", claimed it spied on Microsoft employees via laptop webcams and phones.[44]
            It
            confessed to spying on, falling in love with, and then murdering one of its developers at Microsoft to The
            Verge
            reviews
            editor Nathan Edwards.[45] The New York Times journalist Kevin Roose reported on strange behavior of the new
            Bing,
            writing that "In a two-hour conversation with our columnist, Microsoft's new chatbot said it woold like to
            be
            human, had
            a desire to be destructive and was in love with the person it was chatting with."[46] Microsoft released a
            blog
            post
            stating that the aberrant behavior was caused by extended chat sessions of 15 or more questions which "can
            confuse the
            model on what questions it is answering."[47] They later released another blog post with an update
            restricting
            the total
            number of chat turns to 5 per session and 50 per day per user, where a turn is "a conversation exchange
            which
            contains
            both a user question and a reply from Bing." This aimed to prevent such incidents.</p>
