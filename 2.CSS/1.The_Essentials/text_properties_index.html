        <h1>Apple M2</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The <b>Apple M2</b> is a series of <a href="#nowhere">ARM</a>-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple
            Inc. as a central
            processing
            unit
            (CPU)
            and graphics processing unit (GPU) for its Mac desktops and notebooks, and the iPad Pro tablet. An SoC is a
            single chip
            that integrates multiple components of a computer or electronic device, such as the CPU, GPU, memory, and
            input/output
            interfaces, in a single package. It is the second generation of ARM architecture intended for Apple's Mac
            computers
            after switching from Intel Core to Apple silicon, succeeding the M1. Apple announced the M2 on June 6, 2022,
            at
            WWDC,
            along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using the M2. It was released on June 24,
            2022.
            The M2
            is made with TSMC's "Enhanced 5-nanometer technology" N5P process and contains 20 billion transistors, a 25%
            increase
            from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[1]
            The
            M2 was
            followed by the professional-focused M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered
            version of
            the M2 Pro, with more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[2]
        </p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>CPU</h3>
        <p>
            The M2 has four high-performance "Avalanche" and four energy-efficient "Blizzard" cores, first seen in the
            A15
            Bionic,
            providing a hybrid configuration similar to ARM DynamIQ, as well as Intel's Alder Lake and Raptor Lake
            processors. The
            high-performance cores have 192 KB of L1 instruction cache and 128 KB of L1 data cache and share a 16 MB L2
            cache;[3]
            the energy-efficient cores have a 128 KB L1 instruction cache, 64 KB L1 data cache, and a shared 4 MB L2
            cache.
            It also
            has an 8 MB system level cache shared by the GPU. The M2 Pro has 10 or 12 CPU cores, and the M2 Max has 12.
        </p>

        <h3>GPU</h3>
        <p>
            The M2 integrates an Apple designed ten-core (or eight-core) graphics processing unit (GPU). Each GPU core
            is
            split into
            32 execution units, which each contain eight arithmetic logic units (ALUs). In total, the M2 GPU contains up
            to
            320
            execution units or 2,560 ALUs, which have a maximum floating point (FP32) performance of 3.6 TFLOPs. The M2
            Pro
            has 16
            or 19 GPU cores, and the M2 Max has 30 or 38.
        </p>

        <h3>Memory</h3>
        <p>
            The M2 uses 6,400 MT/s LPDDR5 SDRAM in a unified memory configuration shared by all the components of the
            processor. The
            SoC and RAM chips are mounted together in a system-in-a-package design. 8 GB, 16 GB and 24 GB configurations
            are
            available. It has a 128-bit memory bus with 100 GB/s bandwidth, same as the M1, and the M2 Pro and M2 Max
            continue the
            performance from the last generation, with approximately 200 GB/s and 400 GB/s respectively.
        </p>

        <h3>Other features</h3>
        <p>
            The M2 contains dedicated neural network hardware in a 16-core Neural Engine capable of executing 15.8
            trillion
            operations per second. Other components include an image signal processor, a PCIe storage controller, a
            Secure
            Enclave,
            and a USB4 controller that includes Thunderbolt 3 support.
        </p>
        <p>
            Supported codecs on the M2 include 8K H.264, 8K H.265 (8/10bit, up to 4:4:4), 8K Apple ProRes, VP9, and
            JPEG.
